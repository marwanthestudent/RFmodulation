# Wireless Communication System ‚Äì SDR-Based Implementation

This project presents a full-stack wireless communication system, designed and built using embedded hardware, analog circuits, RF components, and MATLAB-based SDR tools. Developed as part of the **CSE 4377/5392 Wireless Communication** course at UT Arlington, it represents a practical exploration of modern wireless system design.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Firmware and source code are not included in this repository to preserve academic integrity. This repository is for documentation and visual reference only.



## Project Overview

The system implements a baseband-to-RF digital communication chain, featuring:

- **Custom Embedded Transmitter**  
  A TM4C123GXL microcontroller runs a custom-built **numerically controlled oscillator (NCO)** and waveform generator. This module digitally synthesizes modulated signals such as BPSK, QPSK, and 16-QAM by reading from lookup tables and outputting them via a 12-bit DAC.

- **Signal Shaping and Conditioning**  
  Signals are shaped using **raised cosine filters**, and optional hard clipping is applied to study **nonlinear effects** and **spectral regrowth** in analog circuits.

- **Analog Front-End**  
  The analog output chain includes op-amp level shifters and mixers to produce a wide range of carrier frequencies. Signals are transmitted using a custom-designed patch antenna.

- **2.4 GHz Patch Antenna**  
  A microstrip patch antenna was designed in **KiCad**, simulated in **MATLAB**, fabricated, and tested for gain and radiation pattern performance.

- **Wireless Reception and Demodulation**  
  Signals are captured using an **RTL-SDR** dongle through a Raspberry Pi and processed in **MATLAB** for frequency correction, filtering, symbol recovery, and **bit error rate (BER)** analysis.



## Tools & Technologies

- **Hardware**: TI TM4C123GXL, Raspberry Pi 4, MCP4822 DAC, TLC072 op-amps, RTL-SDR v3.
- **Software**: MATLAB, KiCad, SerialTools, SDR#, Code Composer Studio, Embedded C.
- **Test Equipment**: Oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, RF signal generator.



## System Architecture

The wireless transmission system is built from the ground up, with each stage independently verified and integrated into a complete pipeline.



## Key Technical Contributions

‚úÖ **Custom Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO)**  
  Implemented in C on the TM4C123GXL, the NCO generates high-precision baseband signals based on phase accumulation and lookup tables. It forms the core of the digital modulation scheme.

‚úÖ **Multi-Scheme Modulation Support**  
  The firmware supports BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, and 16-QAM using compact lookup tables and symbol mappers.
  In addition to outputting SIN and COS waves across various frequencies with a clipping feature.

‚úÖ **Analog Signal Conditioning**  
  Hardware circuits perform level shifting and IF mixing. Experiments include amplifier compression and spectral analysis of clipped waveforms.

‚úÖ **Antenna Design and Fabrication**  
  Designed a 2.4 GHz rectangular patch antenna with a ground plane and microstrip feed. Simulations matched fabricated measurements closely.

‚úÖ **MATLAB-Based SDR Receiver**  
  Offline scripts process the captured IQ data, apply matched filtering, frequency offset correction, and symbol recovery for BER analysis.
